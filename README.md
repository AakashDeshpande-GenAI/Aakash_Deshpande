ðŸ”­ **My Key Projects:**

1.  **Project 1 : HOMEOBOT - GenAI Homeopathic Doctor**
    *   HOMEOBOT
      Homeobot is an GenAI project where GenAI power is leveraged to treat diseases symptomatically.
      The user has to give history and symptoms faced by patient for diagnosis by following methods :-
      * 1)Image - (analyses image for disease recognition and diagnosis)
      * 2)Voice - (analyses voice for quick diagnosis , disease->diagnosis , medicine->diagnosed for)
      * 3)chatbot - (chat with user , get history and symptoms and diagnose)
Even this includes search grounding - (latest updates about Homeopathic medicines)and Generative agent used for chatting (long conversation)
